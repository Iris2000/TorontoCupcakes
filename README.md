# TorontoCupcakes
The goal of this project was to redesign an existing online website by using HCI principles.
We as a team of 4, came out with a prototype of the interfaces. 
I was responsible to design sign up form, add address form, menu bar, 'My Account',
and control the consistency of the design.
This is the original website that we have chosen to redesign: https://www.torontocupcake.com/
